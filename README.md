# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The model utilizes linear regression to estimate the price of houses in a given dataset. The project includes data visualization techniques to compare actual and predicted house prices.

## Features
- Predict house prices using multiple features.
- Data visualization for better understanding of predictions.
- Use of machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- `TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)`: Actual price of the house in lakhs.
- `SQUARE_FT`: Total area of the house in square feet.
- `BHK_NO.`: Number of bedrooms.
- `BHK_OR_RK`: Type of the house (BHK or RK).
- Additional features that can influence house prices.
